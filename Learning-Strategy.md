3. Kindly explore different python runtimes such as REPL, Notebooks(Jupyter and Colab) and IDEs such as Visual Studio Code and feel free to use the practice with the following python runtimes

 	* https://pythontutor.com (Code Visualizer) ‚≠ê
 	* Pyodide Terminal (not checked)
 	* Google Colab
 	* Starboard Notebook (colab alternative) 

 4. The GrPAs (Graded Programming Assignments) are designed to be a learning experience so they cover individual concepts.
 5. The Programming questions OPPEs(Online Proctored Programming Exams) are in a different format. You can practice the previous terms OPPEs in the Course Portal.
 6. Course Youtube Channel for resources and tutorials: (https://www.youtube.com/@introtopython)
